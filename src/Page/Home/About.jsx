            <p>👨‍💻Hello! I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate passionate about frontend development, currently excelling as an IT executive at ECU Worldwide, a global leader in freight forwarding solutions. While my current role may not directly involve front-end development, I'm actively pursuing my passion for it.
<br /><br />
🚀With a solid foundation in Computer science, I'm driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence and thrive on tackling complex problems. Also, I've completed an online course in frontend development and continue to engage in self-study to stay updated with the latest technologies and trends.
<br /><br />
💡 Specializing in the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—I'm dedicated to transitioning into a frontend development role. Whether it's building captivating user interfaces or enhancing user experiences, I'm committed to honing my skills and making a meaningful impact.
<br /><br />

🔍 I'm actively seeking opportunities to apply my newfound frontend development skills and collaborate with like-minded professionals. Let's connect and explore how we can work together to create innovative solutions!</p>
